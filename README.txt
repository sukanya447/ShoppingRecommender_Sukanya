# Shopping Recommender by machine learning


# Description

A shopping recommender system is a machine learning-based application that provides recommendations for suitable products based on various customer's previous shopping information and preferences. The significance of a shopping recommender using machine learning lies in its ability to enhance personalization, drive sales, improve the user experience, facilitate the discovery of new products, and provide valuable insights for businesses.

The system takes into account several factors e.g. the customer's age, gender, city, platform of shopping, product rate, tax etc to determine to most likely product to purchase. By analyzing historical data and using predictive models, the system provides personalised recommendations tailored to the specific conditions of customer's information.


# Key Features:

Input Data Collection: The system allows users to input relevant data such as Customer_Id, city_code, gender, age, shopping platform etc.

Data Preprocessing: The input data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize or scale features, and transform categorical variables.

Machine Learning Models: Various machine learning algorithms are employed, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and gradient boosting techniques, to build predictive models.

Model Training and Evaluation: The models are trained on historical data and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Product Recommendation: Based on the trained models, the system recommends the most suitable product for the given input parameters with 80% accuracy.


# Technologies used:

Python: Programming language used for model development, data preprocessing, and web application development.

Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for model training, evaluation, and prediction.

Pandas: Data manipulation library used for data preprocessing and analysis.

NumPy: Library for numerical computing used for handling arrays and mathematical operations.

Seaborn: For plotting and data visualization
